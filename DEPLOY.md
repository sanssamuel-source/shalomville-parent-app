# 🚀 Deployment Instructions

## 1. Get Your Code on GitHub

I have already initialized the Git repository for you. Now you just need to push it.

1.  **Create a Repository**: Go to [GitHub.com/new](https://github.com/new) and name it `shalomville-parent-app`.
2.  **Push**: Run these 3 commands in your terminal (I have opened the folder for you):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/shalomville-parent-app.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

_(Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username)_

## 2. Go Live on Vercel

1.  Go to [Vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new).
2.  Select the `shalomville-parent-app` repository you just pushed.
3.  Click **Deploy**.

That's it! Your school app will be live in about 60 seconds.
